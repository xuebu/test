import React from 'react'

const Demo = ({ match }) => (
  <div className="product-sub-layout">
    I didn't take the time to flesh out the product sub layout because it would have been
    just like the user sub layout. The point is that we can have sub layouts this way.
  </div>
)

export default Demo
